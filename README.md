**Java Programming Practice Repository**

This repository contains a collection of Java programs that I've written for practice and learning purposes. Each file focuses on different aspects of Java programming, including data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming concepts, and more.

**Structure**

**Algorithms**: Implementation of common algorithms such as sorting, searching, graph traversal, etc.
**Data Structures**: Implementation of various data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.
**Object-Oriented Programming**: Examples demonstrating concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc.
**Java Basics**: Basic Java programs covering syntax, loops, conditionals, arrays, etc.

**Usage**

Feel free to explore the code, run the programs, and experiment with modifications. This repository is meant to serve as a resource for Java enthusiasts of all skill levels, from beginners to experienced developers looking to brush up on their skills.

**Contribution**

If you find any bugs, have suggestions for improvement, or want to contribute your own Java programs, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are highly encouraged and appreciated!

**Disclaimer**
These programs are primarily for educational purposes and may not always follow best practices or optimal solutions. Use them as a learning tool and refer to official Java documentation or other reliable resources for comprehensive understanding.
